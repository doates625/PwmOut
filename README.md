Written by Dan Oates (WPI Class of 2020)

### Description
This class implements the Mbed PwmOut class for Arduino to allow for cross-platform libraries. This implementation does NOT include the period and pulsewidth methods offered by Mbed as this level of control is not allowed by the standard Arduino library.
